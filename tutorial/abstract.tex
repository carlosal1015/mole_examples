	This document is written for newcomers in MOLE stands
	Mimetic Operators Library Enhanced, but with a solid foundation
	in numerical analysis for PDEs.
	The algorithms are continuously grows in size and quality and the
	examples are diverse implemented independently in
	\href{https://octave.org}{GNU Octave}/
	\href{https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html}{MATLAB}
	and \href{https://isocpp.org}{C++} through Armadillo sparse
	linear algebra library.
	For now, these are exclusively the two language flavours.
	A clear comprenhension will gave you the capabilities to the
	translation into other high-performance scientific languages such
	as \href{https://julialang.org}{Julia},
	\href{https://www.python.org}{Python},
	\href{https://fortran-lang.org}{Fortran},
	\href{https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14}{C} and
	\href{https://www.rust-lang.org}{Rust}.
